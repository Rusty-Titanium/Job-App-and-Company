# Job App and Company
Hello! You might be wondering what this application is all about. Well let me explain what the main purpose of this project is.

## Main Purpose
This app is designed for people that want to keep track of the possibly hundred's of companies/applications that they send out when searching for a new employer.

## What it does
- With the help of the user, the app can create a new 'Company', be given some general information about them, as well as house your jobapplications (kindof)
- You can create a new 'JobApplication' on a company by creating new, and adding in necessary information like the title of the job, its description, its pay, and the date you applied for it. This allows the user to keep track of when they might of applied for a company in the past.

## What it was designed for
- This app was NOT designed to give the user immediate access of all sketchy and up-to-date fake companies leaving out fake jobs to farm Resumes. This app (with help from the user), was designed to help keep track of companies the user added to the list, as well as trust the user has as well as other simple information.

## Why Make this Public
- Good experience to put on a resume amirite?
- In all seriousness, I created this so I can keep track of companies that I have searched up, learn if they are fake, and label them as such so I dont have to do internet sleuthing 50 times for 1 possibly fake company. I also keep track of known good companies so that in the future I can trust them and apply for the company immediately, instead of having to spend upwards of 30 minutes trying to figure out if the company is fake or not.

### I noticed you didn't post the file that would house all the information you have created yourself against these companies. I want to see them too!
- For as much as I would love to be a good samaritan, my internet searching isn't the greatest and last thing I need is a legit company to check out this work, only to find out I flagged them on the "Don't Trust", so uh, you will have to get that information by your own merit :)
